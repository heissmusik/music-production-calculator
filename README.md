# Musical Calculator

I wanted a simple way to calcuate all musical note values in milliseconds based upon a BPM value so I could set rhythmic delay and reverb times that were in tempo with the music.

I was tired of using an actual calculator with the formula 60000 divided by BPM to get a 1/4 note and then proceeding with divisions from there.

You can see and use it [here](http://heissmusik.com/music-production-calculator/)
